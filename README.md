This project represents data collected from Airbnb to visualize travel trends and pricing.

Key insights from the dashboard include:
- Travel peaks during winter (end of the year) and mid-summer.
- Average prices for various bedroom options and their selection frequency.
- Periods with higher ticket prices throughout the year.
- States with the highest travel costs.
  
These visualizations facilitate understanding and enable targeted improvements to the travel system.
